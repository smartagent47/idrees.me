            <p>
              A mobile application which predicts multiple potholes on a road
              from a single image &amp; calculates parameters like length, width
              and depth of it using the same image.

              Overview
            </h6>
            <p>
              Citizen Service solutions enabling citizens not only report any
              visible issues but also follow up those problems till proper
              resolution. It started with reporting any problems around them and
              share the images. Citizens can report these problems by clicking
              and uploading photograph. Subsequent follow-ups will be with
              clicking of clicking and uploading photographs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once those problems resolved by authorities then the same should
              also be validated by Citizens themselves by taking photographs &
              upload them. The system will identify weather itâ€™s resolved or
              not.

              Approach
            </h6>
            <p>
              The user captures an image using the application which is stored
              onto the server. This image is resized to 760x1280 pixels. We then
              detect the pothole using a machine learning model that gives us
              the position and approximate boundaries of the pothole. We then
              use a known object such as a coin as a reference to measure the
              approximate parameters of the pothole &amp; estimate its severity.

              Role
            </h6>
            <p>
              Since we did not have our client coupled up with the machine
              learning model directly, we had to use a server in between. My
              task here was to create a pipeline between the client i.e Android
              and our model which was written in Python. Using Node.js, I built
              the custom APIs which were exposed to the application for getting
              the image. A child process was initiated to execute the model
              &amp; passing the image. Using the same pipe, parameters
              calculated were returned to the client.
