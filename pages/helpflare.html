              Overview
            </h6>
            <p>
              During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India, good
              Samaritans and NGOs stepped up to help under-privileged localities
              with basic needs like food, water, sanitation, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              To help their efforts, I along with my classmates created an app
              that used Geo-fencing technology to highlight communities that
              were in need.
            </p>

          <div class="col-sm-12 text-center my-4">

              The motive of this project was to contribute to the society and to
              the man-kind using the most available luxury i.e technology. The
              issues faced by the people were lack of daily necessities. To
              solve it, we came up with an approach which gives a broad field of
              view to the social groups/clubs or NGOs and would make their help
              deliveries faster to more people in the coverage.

              Approach
            </h6>
            <ul style="padding: 0; list-style-type: none;">
              <li>
                - Any citizen of the locality, reports an area where help is
                needed, to the application with data such as number of families,
                resources needed and details of the reporter.
              </li>
              <li>
                - This area is marked on a Google Map to which any group
                registered, can deliver the help.
              </li>
              <li>
                - These groups then contact the reporter of that area for more
                clear details and distribute the essentials.
              </li>
            </ul>

              Role
            </h6>
            <p>
              My <span class="bold">responsibilities</span> in the project were
              to build the APIs and model the data which was to be stored in
              MongoDB. Authentication, Report creation, Geo-fencing &
              Confirmation of help delivered, were the core features of the
              application.

              To cater to a larger reach, Help Flare got featured into
              newspapers like Times of India, Hindustan Times and an educational
              digest known as Higher Educational Digest. Although, we could only
              help a few people around us, the purpose was served i.e to help
              the needy, in a crisis which we all went through.
